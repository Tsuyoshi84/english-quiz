For Svelte+TypeScript users,\n * you want to provide typings. Therefore you create a `index.d.ts`:\n * ```ts\n * import { SvelteComponentTyped } from \"svelte\";\n * export class MyComponent extends SvelteComponentTyped<{foo: string}> {}\n * ```\n * Typing this makes it possible for IDEs like VS Code with the Svelte extension\n * to provide intellisense and to use the component like this in a Svelte file\n * with TypeScript:\n * ```svelte\n * <script lang=\"ts\">\n * \timport { MyComponent } from \"component-library\";\n * </script>\n * <MyComponent foo={'bar'} />\n * ```\n *\n * #### Why not make this part of `SvelteComponent(Dev)`?\n * Because\n * ```ts\n * class ASubclassOfSvelteComponent extends SvelteComponent<{foo: string}> {}\n * const component: typeof SvelteComponent = ASubclassOfSvelteComponent;\n * ```\n * will throw a type error, so we need to seperate the more strictly typed class.\n */\nclass SvelteComponentTyped extends SvelteComponentDev {\n    constructor(options) {\n        super(options);\n    }\n}\nfunction loop_guard(timeout) {\n    const start = Date.now();\n    return () => {\n        if (Date.now() - start > timeout) {\n            throw new Error('Infinite loop detected');\n        }\n    };\n}\n\nexport { HtmlTag, SvelteComponent, SvelteComponentDev, SvelteComponentTyped, SvelteElement, action_destroyer, add_attribute, add_classes, add_flush_callback, add_location, add_render_callback, add_resize_listener, add_transform, afterUpdate, append, append_dev, assign, attr, attr_dev, attribute_to_object, beforeUpdate, bind, binding_callbacks, blank_object, bubble, check_outros, children, claim_component, claim_element, claim_html_tag, claim_space, claim_text, clear_loops, component_subscribe, compute_rest_props, compute_slots, createEventDispatcher, create_animation, create_bidirectional_transition, create_component, create_in_transition, create_out_transition, create_slot, create_ssr_component, current_component, custom_event, dataset_dev, debug, destroy_block, destroy_component, destroy_each, detach, detach_after_dev, detach_before_dev, detach_between_dev, detach_dev, dirty_components, dispatch_dev, each, element, element_is, empty, end_hydrating, escape, escape_attribute_value, escape_object, escaped, exclude_internal_props, fix_and_destroy_block, fix_and_outro_and_destroy_block, fix_position, flush, getContext, get_binding_group_value, get_current_component, get_custom_elements_slots, get_slot_changes, get_slot_context, get_spread_object, get_spread_update, get_store_value, globals, group_outros, handle_promise, hasContext, has_prop, identity, init, insert, insert_dev, intros, invalid_attribute_name_character, is_client, is_crossorigin, is_empty, is_function, is_promise, listen, listen_dev, loop, loop_guard, missing_component, mount_component, noop, not_equal, now, null_to_empty, object_without_properties, onDestroy, onMount, once, outro_and_destroy_block, prevent_default, prop_dev, query_selector_all, raf, run, run_all, safe_not_equal, schedule_update, select_multiple_value, select_option, select_options, select_value, self, setContext, set_attributes, set_current_component, set_custom_element_data, set_data, set_data_dev, set_input_type, set_input_value, set_now, set_raf, set_store_value, set_style, set_svg_attributes, space, spread, start_hydrating, stop_propagation, subscribe, svg_element, text, tick, time_ranges_to_array, to_number, toggle_class, transition_in, transition_out, update_await_block_branch, update_keyed_each, update_slot, update_slot_spread, validate_component, validate_each_argument, validate_each_keys, validate_slots, validate_store, xlink_attr };\n","export { identity as linear } from '../internal/index.mjs';\n\n/*\nAdapted from https://github.com/mattdesl\nDistributed under MIT License https://github.com/mattdesl/eases/blob/master/LICENSE.md\n*/\nfunction backInOut(t) {\n    const s = 1.70158 * 1.525;\n    if ((t *= 2) < 1)\n        return 0.5 * (t * t * ((s + 1) * t - s));\n    return 0.5 * ((t -= 2) * t * ((s + 1) * t + s) + 2);\n}\nfunction backIn(t) {\n    const s = 1.70158;\n    return t * t * ((s + 1) * t - s);\n}\nfunction backOut(t) {\n    const s = 1.70158;\n    return --t * t * ((s + 1) * t + s) + 1;\n}\nfunction bounceOut(t) {\n    const a = 4.0 / 11.0;\n    const b = 8.0 / 11.0;\n    const c = 9.0 / 10.0;\n    const ca = 4356.0 / 361.0;\n    const cb = 35442.0 / 1805.0;\n    const cc = 16061.0 / 1805.0;\n    const t2 = t * t;\n    return t < a\n        ?
