# English Quiz

![Build and Deploy](https://github.com/Tsuyoshi84/english-quiz/workflows/Build%20and%20Deploy/badge.svg)

Play [here](https://tsuyoshi84.github.io/english-quiz).

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
pnpm i
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost. To allow connections from other computers, edit the `sirv` commands in package.json to include the option `--host 0.0.0.0`.

## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
pnpm build
```
